# DOM Manipulation Practice

Welcome to the DOM Manipulation Practice repository! This repository provides a structured set of exercises to help you progressively learn and master DOM manipulation using JavaScript. It includes a model HTML document and CSS file to get you started.

---

## **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites
- A text editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text).
- A browser with a developer console (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

### Folder Structure
/dom-exe │ ├── index.html # The main HTML file ├── styles.css # The CSS file for styling └── scripts.js # JavaScript file for your practice code

### Setup
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the base page.
3. Write your JavaScript code in `scripts.js` to practice the exercises.

## **Exercise Set**

The exercises are divided into six levels, progressing from basic to advanced. Each level builds on the skills learned in the previous levels.

### **Level 1: Basics of Selection and Content Manipulation**
1. Select elements by ID, class, and tag and log them to the console.
2. Change the `textContent` of an element (e.g., `#basic-paragraph`).
3. Update the `innerHTML` of an element to include new HTML tags.
4. Use `querySelectorAll` to select multiple elements and log their content.
5. Navigate to an element’s parent and siblings (e.g., using `parentNode` and `nextElementSibling`).

---

### **Level 2: Attribute and Style Manipulation**
6. Change the `src` attribute of an image (e.g., `#basic-image`).
7. Update the `href` and `title` attributes of a link (e.g., `#basic-link`).
8. Apply multiple inline styles dynamically using `style.cssText`.
9. Add, remove, and toggle CSS classes (e.g., `highlight` for the hover box).
10. Dynamically manipulate multiple styles on a button click.

---

### **Level 3: Event Handling**
11. Add a click event to a button that changes the text of an element (e.g., `#click-me-btn`).
12. Add hover effects to an element (e.g., change the background color of `#hover-box`).
13. Capture and display real-time input in the `#output-text` paragraph.
14. Prevent a link’s default action and show an alert instead.
15. Use a keyboard event to log every key typed in the input field.

---

### **Level 4: DOM Structure Manipulation**
16. Add a new `<li>` to the `#list` dynamically on button click.
17. Remove a specific child element from the `#list`.
18. Replace an element dynamically (e.g., replace a `<p>` with a `<div>`).
19. Shuffle the order of the `<li>` elements in the list.
20. Dynamically wrap all paragraphs in a `<div>`.

---

### **Level 5: Advanced Manipulations**
21. Create a dynamic table with rows and columns using `createElement` and `appendChild`.
22. Build an accordion where clicking a header shows/hides its content (e.g., `#accordion`).
23. Implement a countdown timer that updates every second.
24. Highlight all occurrences of a word in a paragraph.
25. Autofill a form field based on a dropdown selection.

---

### **Level 6: Mini Projects**
26. Build a sortable list where users can drag and drop items to reorder them.
27. Create a tab navigation system where clicking a tab displays relevant content.
28. Implement a character counter for the input field.
29. Build an image lightbox that displays an image in a modal when clicked.
30. Create a dynamic quiz app with multiple questions and a score tracker.

---

## **Tips for Success**
- Use `console.log()` to debug and inspect changes in the DOM.
- Experiment with additional methods like `cloneNode`, `replaceChild`, and `insertBefore`.
- Try to solve each exercise without looking at hints, then review the solution for best practices.
